Hard Flaccid Syndrome (HFS) is a relatively rare condition effecting the male genitalia and pelvic region. It is characterized by a persistent semi-rigid state of the penis, which remains this way without any sexual desire or arousal. HFS can cause significant physical discomfort, pain and a range of emotional and psychological challenges due to its impact on sexual function and overall quality of life.

The name "Hard Flaccid Syndrome" derives from the paradoxical nature of the condition and was originally coined by men on internet forums. The term "hard" refers to the semi-rigid state of the penis, while "flaccid" indicates that this hardness or rigidity is present when the penis is supposed to be at rest, or flaccid. This juxtaposition of terms highlights the unique and confusing symptoms experienced by those with HFS. The condition has only recently started to gain attention in medical research and among healthcare professionals, making awareness and advocacy crucial for advancing understanding and developing effective treatment options for those afflicted.
