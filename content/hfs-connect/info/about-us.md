This website was created by and is managed by individuals who suffer from Hard Flaccid Syndrome (HFS). As members of the broader HFS community, we intimately understand the physical and emotional challenges that come with this condition. Our firsthand experiences drive our commitment to providing accurate information, meaningful support and a compassionate community for others navigating the same journey. We aim to empower, educate and advocate for those affected by HFS, ensuring that no one has to face this condition alone.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to raise awareness, accelerate the research process, advocate for better treatments and to offer a glimmer of hope to those currently afflicted by HFS. We believe in the power of collective effort and compassion to drive change, improve lives and ultimately find a cure for this awful condition. We are unwavering in our commitment and will not stop until a cure is found.
