### How do I know if I have Hard Flaccid Syndrome (HFS)?

The most obvious sign that one has HFS is if their flaccid penis is in a constant firm and retracted state. Other symptoms associated with HFS can be viewed [here](/about-hfs/pages/signs-and-symptoms/). If you suspect that you have HFS, we recommend seeing a doctor that specializes in sexual medicine and men’s health issues to receive a formal diagnosis since most doctors – including urologists – will be unfamiliar with the condition.

### What causes HFS?

Visit our “[causes](/about-hfs/pages/causes/)” page.

### How long will I have HFS and will it go away on its own?

Currently, there is no way of determining how long HFS will last for those who have it and whether or not it will go away on its own. It is unlikely that HFS will resolve spontaneously without medical intervention.

### Has anyone been cured of HFS?

The following [case report](https://academic.oup.com/jsm/article-abstract/19/Supplement_1/S103/7013081?redirectedFrom=fulltext) is the only verified account of someone being cured of HFS in current scientific literature. The individual reportedly cured himself from specialized pelvic floor physical therapy.

The 23 year old who underwent a left transforaminal epidural spinal injection and eventually a left L5-S1 lumbar endoscopic interlaminar discectomy for a L5-S1 disc protrusion with annular tear, as featured in [Goldstein’s article](https://auanews.net/issues/articles/2023/may-2023/hard-flaccid-syndrome-proposed-to-be-secondary-to-pathological-activation-of-a-pelvic/pudendal-hypogastric-reflex), reported significant reduction in HFS symptoms.

Several self-reportedly "cured" cases have been shared and circulated across various internet forums, though due to the nature of the internet can not be confirmed or verified.

### Should I masturbate or have sex with HFS?

Because HFS can be worsened by sexual activity, abstinence is preferable though not always recommended. It’s best to know your own body’s limitations and go from there. Generally, people with HFS tolerate sexual intercourse better than masturbation. If you are experiencing pain, please avoid all sexual activity.

### Is HFS a manifestation of Peyronie’s disease?

No. HFS and Peyronie's disease are two separate conditions. Though there may be some symptom overlap, the underlying cause or mechanism of each condition is different.

### Can someone with HFS also have Peyronie’s disease?

While it is possible, most people with HFS do not have Peyronie's disease. If you are worried about Peyronie's disease, it is best to speak with a Urologist and have the necessary tests done to rule out or confirm that you have the condition.

### Is HFS a manifestation of pelvic floor dysfunction?

Though people with HFS may also present with pelvic floor dysfunction, with what we know about the condition already, in addition to the lackluster reported efficacy of pelvic floor physical therapy as a treatment method, it is unlikely that pelvic floor dysfunction alone is the cause of HFS; it is more likely, however, that pelvic floor dysfunction is a biproduct of HFS. Pelvic floor physical therapy is still recommended as a first-line treatment option, but for the overwhelming majority of cases is not effective in curing or relieving symptoms of HFS.

### Is HFS a manifestation of Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CPPS)?

Since many with HFS will experience chronic pain in or around the pelvis, CPPS can be a biproduct of HFS.

### Is HFS a manifestation of pudendal neurologia, entrapment or compression?

It is unclear at this time. More research is required.

<!--
### Can HFS be caused by the use of SSRIs, Finasteride, or other prescription drugs?

The current state of knowledge suggests that this is unlikely to be a direct cause of HFS.

### Can HFS be caused by hormone imbalances?

The current state of knowledge suggests that this is unlikely to be a direct cause of HFS.

### Can HFS be caused by a poor diet, sleep patterns or vitamin deficiencies?

The current state of knowledge suggests that this is unlikely to be a direct cause of HFS.

### Can HFS be caused by postural issues?

The current state of knowledge suggests that this is unlikely to be a direct cause of HFS.

### Can HFS be caused by stress, anxiety or other mental conditions?

The current state of knowledge suggests that this is unlikely to be a direct cause of HFS, though certainly can be a biproduct of HFS.

### Can HFS be caused by anything else?

The cause or causes of HFS are not fully understood. Due to the nature of the condition and the current state of knowledge, more research is required.
