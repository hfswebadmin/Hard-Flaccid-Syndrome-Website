At the moment, there is no official protocol for diagnosing Hard Flaccid Syndrome (HFS) in a clinical setting, making it a challenging condition for both patients and healthcare providers. The absence of standardized diagnostic criteria means that there is no universally accepted method for identifying or categorizing HFS, leading to varied interpretations and approaches among medical professionals. The overwhelming majority of patients with HFS diagnose themselves with the condition after extensively searching their symptoms online. When HFS patients seek professional medical advice, they often encounter doctors who are unaware of the condition. This lack of clarity can contribute to misdiagnosis, frustration and a sense of helplessness among patients, as they often undergo numerous tests and consultations without receiving a definitive diagnosis or effective treatment plan. Consequently, the journey to understanding and managing HFS is often prolonged and fraught with uncertainty.
