## Diagnostics

At the moment, there is no official protocol for diagnosing Hard Flaccid Syndrome (HFS) in a clinical setting. The overwhelming majority of patients diagnose themselves after googling their symptoms online.

On physical examination, a person with HFS will have a shrunken, firm flaccid penis. You may also notice discoloration, prominent veins or ripples in the skin on the shaft.
