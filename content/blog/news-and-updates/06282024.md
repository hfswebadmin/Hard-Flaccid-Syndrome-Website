We are thrilled to announce the launch of our new website, hardflaccidsyndrome.org, which is dedicated to sharing the most up-to-date information about Hard Flaccid Syndrome (HFS) and providing support for those currently suffering from the condition. Our platform is designed to be a comprehensive resource for those affected by HFS, healthcare professionals and researchers alike. We hope to shed light on this poorly understood condition and drive advancements in its research, treatment and management.

The launch of this website is just the beginning. We will work relentlessly until those suffering from HFS have access to the support and solutions they so desperately need.

<center>Of the community. By the community. For the community.</center>
